Hi, my name is Michael Lee, and I'm a software and app developer! I recently received my AAS from Spartanburg Community College and am working hard towards a BS in Computer Science at University of South Carolina Upstate.

I have been programming since I was 13, releasing my first app at 15 years old. Since then, I have loved to create things. I like to think of myself like a sculptor, and code is my clay!

Today, I focus on building Android apps, desktop applications, and web solutions, blending strong technical foundations with thoughtful, user-centered design. I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and optimizing performance under the hood. I'm also constantly learning new technologies.

Coding Skills:

1. C#
2. Kotlin
3. Java
4. C++
5. ASP.NET
6. Python
7. HTML

Education: Spartanburg Community College
